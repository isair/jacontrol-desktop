This is an application for sending rcon commands to Jedi Academy servers without going in game. Added servers will be synced using OneDrive for Windows. For other operating systems there is no automatic syncing capability but your data will persist between sessions.

It is a Java application and will work on Windows, OS X, and Linux. It is portable and requires no installation.

## Requirements

- [JDK 9](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html)

## Development

1. There are no code editor or IDE specific files in this repository, so feel free to use your favourite one.

2. Initialise [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and create an appropriate branch.

3. Make sure your commit messages conform to the standards explained [here](https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-changelog-metahub#commit-types).

4. Manually test your changes. Be thorough. You can write your own unit tests and integration tests as well but since there are no tests at the moment, this is not required.
